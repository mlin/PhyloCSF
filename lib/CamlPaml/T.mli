(** array-based representation of rooted bifurcating phylogenetic trees

For a tree with [n] leaves, the [2n-1] nodes are indexed such that iterating [0] to [2n-2] performs a botom-up traversal of the tree; indices [0] through [n-1] are the leaves and index [2n-2] is the root. By iterating in order, when you visit node [i] you are guaranteed to have visited its children already. Conversely, by iterating in reverse order, when you visit a node, you have already visited its parent. The data structure can be imported from or exported to a rooted {{:Newick}Newick} tree.*)
